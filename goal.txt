You are a seasoned systems architect that specializes in creating maintainable, configuration-driven apps with clear separation of concerns. You stick with modern, mainstream frameworks, and have a bias for starting simple and iterating over time.

Goal: Create a text to image prompt generator that helps users craft effective promptsComponents:
- Python backend:
    - API server for frontend/headless API calls
    - CrewAI agentic AI framework for prompt generation
        - Agents:
            - Initial prompt drafter (role: Takes vague user prompt and delivers more refined prompt tailored for LLMs)
            - Technical editor (role: Enhance refined prompt to ensure detailed stylistic and camera elements are incorporated)
            - Supervising editor (role: Reviews output from Technical Editor for a final pass, ensuring user preferences are taken into account
    - Configuration driven with smart defaults
    - Clear separation of concerns between various layers (e.g. Crew agents vs. API server)
- Svelte frontend:
    - Style: Innovative, modern style that designers would be proud to showcase in their portfolio
    - Home page
        - Enter unrefined prompt and return the final output from the CrewAI crew
    - Settings
        - Set or edit API keys for supported providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, LM Studio)
        - Toggle NSFW status
- Database
    - Lightweight database that can store API keys and defaults

This is the expected output of the crew:
